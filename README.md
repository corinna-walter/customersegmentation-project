# Customer Segmentation Project
## Project Overview
This project analyses the data set of an e-commerce platform and creates a segmentation of the customer data. 
Firstly, the project uses the Group-by function to ‘manually’ create customer categories. In addition, the project uses K-Mean Clustering to create a customer segmentation based on the number of transactions (frequency), time interval to last purchase (recency) and total revenue per customer. 
The goal is to help improve marketing strategies to the different customer segments and increase customer loyalty.
